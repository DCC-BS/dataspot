## How to do regular updates (not yet implemented):
Frequent updates of details of already published datasets (e.g. last_updated field) are not updated directly through dataspot. but instead through a file managed by the Data Competence Center DCC. This means that fields that should be updated outside of the workflow are written to the centrally managed file instead of dataspot directly. These changes are then regularly updated by a script from the DCC to dataspot.
